\o ERROR (ADEXL-5031): While simulating run Interactive.22, point 1, test TOP:top_tb:1, received error:
\o Simulation Error:
\o  ------------------------------
\o  Simulator failed to complete the simulation.
\o  The simulator process returned a non-zero exit code, indicating failure.
\o The simulator could have crashed or intentionally returned to indicate an error.
\o Check the simulator log file for more information.  Common causes:
\o 1. Simulator may have crashed during exit even after reporting success in log file.
\o 2. Abrupt automatic simulator termination (e.g., SIGKILL) because the simulator process has
\o    exceeded resource limits, which can be specified in the distribution system or
\o    by the kernel itself (e.g., the Linux OOMKiller).
\o 3. Manual termination of the simulator process.
\o ./runSimulation can be manually run in this directory to check the issue.
\o
