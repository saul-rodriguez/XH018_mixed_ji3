Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(I0.M0.m1:int_d) = 40.01 V
I: I(V0:p) = 3.376 mA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.

Post-Transient Simulation Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   -   To further speed up simulation, consider
          add ++aps on command line
   -   The circuit contains signals of the voltage > 10V, consider to set highvoltage=yes to get better accuracy and convergence ability.
