Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 351 us, elapsed = 351.191 us.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 352 us, elapsed = 352.144 us.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 388 us, elapsed = 390.053 us.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 319 us, elapsed = 319.004 us.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 329 us, elapsed = 329.018 us.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 327 us, elapsed = 327.11 us.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Error found by spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    ERROR (SPECTRE-16385): There were 13 attempts to find the DC solution. In some of those attempts, a signal exceeded the blowup limit of its quantity. The last signal that failed is V(net11) = -1.41131 GV, for which the quantity is `V' and the blowup limit is (1 GV). It is possible that the circuit has no DC solution. If you really want signals this large, set the `blowup' parameter of this quantity to a larger value.
    ERROR (SPECTRE-16080): Cannot print DC solution because DC did not converge. Resolve the convergence issue and rerun the simulation.

Error found by spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    ERROR (SPECTRE-16385): There were 13 attempts to find the DC solution. In some of those attempts, a signal exceeded the blowup limit of its quantity. The last signal that failed is V(net11) = -1.50979 GV, for which the quantity is `V' and the blowup limit is (1 GV). It is possible that the circuit has no DC solution. If you really want signals this large, set the `blowup' parameter of this quantity to a larger value.
    ERROR (SPECTRE-16080): Cannot print DC solution because DC did not converge. Resolve the convergence issue and rerun the simulation.
         

The values for those nodes that did not converge on the last Newton iteration are given below.  The manner in which the convergence criteria were not satisfied is also given.
