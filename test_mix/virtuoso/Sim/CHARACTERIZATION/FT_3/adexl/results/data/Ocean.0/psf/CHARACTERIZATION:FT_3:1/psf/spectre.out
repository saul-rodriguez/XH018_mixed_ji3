Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 337 us, elapsed = 336.885 us.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 286 us, elapsed = 286.102 us.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 405 us, elapsed = 405.073 us.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

Notice from spectre during DC analysis, during AC analysis `ac'.
    Bad pivoting is found during DC analysis. Option dc_pivot_check=yes is recommended for possible improvement of convergence.

DC simulation time: CPU = 303 us, elapsed = 303.03 us.
